# loadbalncer- Load Balancer Deployment with NIC Configuration in Azure
Project Description:

In this project, we will deploy a load balancer solution in Microsoft Azure to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple Azure virtual machines (VMs). The load balancer will be configured with multiple Network Interface Cards (NICs), each assigned with one or more IP addresses, to manage traffic across different Azure virtual networks and handle various services or applications hosted on the backend VMs.
